```dart
class Conversation {
  final String id;
  final List<String> participantIds;
  final String? jobId;
  final String title;
  final String lastMessagePreview;
  final int unreadCount;
  final DateTime updatedAt;
}

class Message {

## Backend Integration

### Existing Backend Models Used:
1. **teamMember.model.js** - Team member schema with permissions
2. **conversation.model.js** - Conversation with participants and metadata
3. **message.model.js** - Message schema with sender and content
4. **business.controller.js** - Team management endpoints
5. **conversation.controller.js** - Messaging endpoints

### API Routes Integrated:
- Business team management routes
- Conversation CRUD operations  
- Message sending and retrieval
- User authentication and authorization

## Navigation Flow

```
Employer Profile Screen
├── Messaging (Header Button) → Messaging Screen
│   └── Conversation Detail → Individual Chat
├── Team Management (Button) → Team Management Screen
│   ├── Add Member → Invite Dialog
│   └── Member Actions → Edit/Remove
└── Business Manager (Links) → Business Management
```

## State Management

**AppState Integration:**
- Added `selectedBusinessId` property for team management context
- Leverages existing `businesses` list for profile display

## Error Handling

**Comprehensive Error Management:**
- Network request failures with user feedback
- Form validation with inline error messages
- Loading states with spinners and placeholders
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations

## Performance Optimizations

**Efficiency Features:**
- Lazy loading of conversations and messages
- Search filtering without API calls
- Cached user data from AppState
- Optimized list rendering with ListView.builder
- Memory management with proper disposal

## Security Considerations

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- JWT token authentication via HttpService
- User role validation in UI components
- Team member permission checks
- Business ownership validation
- Secure API endpoint access

## Future Enhancements

**Planned Features:**
- Push notifications for new messages
- File attachment support in messages
- Team member profile management
- Advanced permission granularity
- Message encryption
- Offline message queuing
- Real-time message updates via WebSocket
